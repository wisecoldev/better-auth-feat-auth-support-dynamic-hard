"""Compute SLOC metrics from unified diffs.

Uses ``unidiff`` for diff parsing and ``pygments`` for language-aware comment
detection.

Limitation — block comments: each changed line is tokenized in isolation, so a
prose line inside ``/* */`` without a comment-like prefix (``*``, ``#``, ``//``)
is miscounted as code. This is inherent to diff-only analysis without full file
context; in practice the impact is small.
