"""Reusable verifier/reward library for Staff-Bench.

Dual-namespace contract: this package must import correctly under BOTH
``src.python.ssb_lib`` (offline) and ``ssb_lib`` (in-container). This works
because every intra-package import is RELATIVE, so it binds via the runtime
``__package__`` regardless of absolute name and without touching ``sys.path``;
data files are resolved relative to their module file.
